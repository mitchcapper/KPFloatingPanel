OLDER CHANGELOG
-----
6.1 (2012-10-07) changed by MitchCapper
 - Rewrote code dealing with sub-group menus that was very broken (and caused crashes)
 - Enable update notification support.

6.0 (2012-10-06) changed by MitchCapper
 - Added ability to have a shortcut key for copying a random password to the clipboard
 - Fixed expiring entries and how they showed up
 - Don't show search/last entry items when not right
 - Minor other fixes

2.0.12 (2010.08.08) changed by MitchCapper
 -  Made searching so you can type multiple parts of an entry title (seperated by spaces) and it will find the entry even if the parts are not next to each other
 -  Added LastEntry support from Deltamaxx
 -  Dual Monitor Fixes

2.0.9.1(2009.10.19) changed by MitchCapper
 -  Save Database button added to drop down
 -  Ability to set starting group for entries, instead of starting just at the root you can choose to start at a sub-group instead, should safe people from having to constantly go to one subfolder.
 -  Ability to hide the clock
 -  Ability to set a global hot key that will bring it up (IE hitting shift + K will open the floating panel).
 -  Ability to choose if you want folders or entries first
 -  Ability to perform the default action for an entry by just double clicking
 -  Removed the floating panel from showing up in the ALT-Tab list.
 -  Ability to search right from the floating panel.  When search is enabled a textbox will appear as the top of the list, and any time it opens it will have focus by default.  As you type it will search the list and show you as you type the results.  You can then interact with the results or just hit enter and the first ones default action will be taken.  This allows for complete keyboard interaction with the floating panel, hit the global hot key, type part of the entry you want, hit enter, and your done.  When you search it flatens out all the groups, so even if the entry is in a sub-group it will show up in the results
